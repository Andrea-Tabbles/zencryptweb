This repository is meant for a quick working example of file encryption over
the browser with Zenroom [Zenroom VM](https://zenroom.dyne.org) using 
the [Zencode human-friendly language for smart-contracts](https://decodeproject.eu/blog/smart-contracts-english-speaker).

This opens also to many scenario like multikey sign encryption and so on...
